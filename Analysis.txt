To break down the YouTube homepage layout, I first analyzed the page as a whole and focused on identifying the largest structural sections instead of individual details. Using the “Lego blocks” approach, I treated the webpage as a combination of big blocks that form the foundation of the layout. These major sections include the Header, Sidebar, Main Video Content Area, Shorts Section, and Footer. This method helped me understand the overall structure of the page and made the design feel more organized and manageable.

After identifying the major sections, I examined each block to determine the smaller elements it contains. The Header includes the hamburger menu, YouTube logo, search bar, mic icon, upload, notificaftion, and profile icon, while the Sidebar contains navigation links such as Home, Shorts, Subscriptions, Channel. The Main Video Content Area is made up of a grid of video cards, each containing a thumbnail, title, channel name, time, and view count. Below this grid, the Shorts Section displays short-form videos in a horizontal layout, clearly separated from regular video content. And lastly the footer on the left side bar.

Finally, I created a sketch to visually represent how these sections are arranged and how they relate to one another on the page. The sketch focuses on structure rather than design details, helping me visualize how the layout could be built using CSS layout techniques like Flexbox. Breaking the page into clear, labeled blocks made it easier to plan the layout and will help me code complex webpages more efficiently in future projects.
